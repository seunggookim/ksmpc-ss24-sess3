% [EXAMPLES]
% gender difference (1=female, 2=male) across 3 groups

% language difference (1=eng, 2=chn, 3=kor) across 2 groups

General approach:
- Generate a null hypothesis (H0) about population proportions.
- Compute frequencies that we would expect if H0 was true.
- Summarize the discrepancy between these with a single statistic (Î§2)
- Use the distribution of all of the statistics that we could have observed
if the null hypothesis was true to determine whether this statistic would
be unlikely if the null hypothesis was true.
